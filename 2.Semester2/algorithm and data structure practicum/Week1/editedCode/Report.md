### **Brief Explanation:**  There are 6 main step: 
1. Input NIM** – User enters their NIM.  
2. Get Last Two Digits – Extracts the last two digit (`n`).  
3. Ensure `n ≥ 10` – If `n < 10`, add 10.  
4. Loop from 1 to `n` – Iterates through numbers up to `n`.  
5. Skip 6 and 10 – These numbers are not printed.  
6. Print Even or `*` – Even numbers are printed; odd numbers are replaced with `*`.
